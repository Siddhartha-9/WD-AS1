        <h2>Reflection of module experience</h2>
        <p>I found the Web Development module to be incredibly exciting. It is undoubtedly an amazing course, but I
            faced some challenges along the way. Since even the basics of this subject were not taught in my home
            country, Nepal, I initially struggled to keep up. However, I realized that consistently practicing the
            exercises each week would have made it easier for me to understand the proper use of HTML tags in different
            contexts.

            Fortunately, our module leader uploaded video recordings of each week's lessons on NILE, which gave me the
            opportunity to learn at my own pace. Having a tutor like Chris has been an excellent experience,his teaching
            skills are outstanding, and I truly appreciate his clear and detailed explanations. He ensures that every
            concept is well understood, highlighting not only what to use but also what to avoid.

            Overall, this module has been a great learning experience. It introduced me to many valuable concepts that
            will undoubtedly be beneficial in the future. I am grateful for the knowledge I have gained and look forward
            to applying these skills in my career.</p>

        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>The sources for my website design are all the contents taught by my tutor.In week 2, I learned about the grid
            exercise, where we had to create different types of grid layouts. My inspiration for my design was from my
            tutor's portfolio he showed us. I liked every single design decisions he used on his website, the color
            combination, the grid layouts,etc. That's why I created my portfolio website with same grid design but its
            definitely not good looking as his. I kept font and background color like this because I think light looking
            background with brown text color would look great. </p>
