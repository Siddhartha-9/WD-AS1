            <h2>Book Ordering Application</h2>
            <p>During my problem solving and programming module, we were given assignment of creating a book ordering
                application. So i did it and this project successfully integrates a book ordering system, shipping cost
                calculation,
                invoice management, and GUI implementation into a single application. By incorporating OOP principles,
                it enhances maintainability and scalability, ensuring a well-structured and efficient solution</p>

            <h2>Requirement specification for zoo</h2>
            <p>In Sofware engineering fundamentals module, we had a group project where we had to specify the
                requirements of zoo and then develop a software for the zoo. I was in mobile app group and with group
                effort we created page for the mobile app. This was designed which would be able to purchase tickets,
                navigate maps, but sponsorship and membership, plan visit to zoo, etc from this mobile application.</p>

            <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>For the web development module, I designed and built a good looking portfolio website to showcase my
                projects and technical skills and professional background. It has fully responsive design, has dynamic
                project showcase and also contact section.</p>

            <h2>Computer Networking</h2>
            <p>In computer communications module, we had to establish connections between two or more computers
                using packet tracer and wireshark. We had to find the best possible path for the data to be
                transferred. We had to learn about the OSI model which contains 7 layers and study about them in
                details and also study about IP adresses, subnet mask, etc.</p>
